We present the first Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (1-OGC), obtained by using the public data from Advanced LIGO's first observing run to search for compact-object binary mergers. Our analysis is based on new methods that improve the separation between signals and noise in matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from the merger of compact objects.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

In July 2020, NASAâ€™s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \citep{Ricker:2015:JATIS} completed its two-year Primary Mission to search for transiting exoplanets around nearby bright stars. 
\tess\ recorded 2-minute cadence observations for $\sim200,000$ pre-selected stars that were processed by the \tess\ Science Processing Operations Center \citep{Jenkins:2016:SPIE} pipeline. 
Additionally, \tess\ also recorded measurements of its entire field of view in 10 and 30-minute sampled full-frame images (FFIs), enabling the flux measurements of tens of millions of stars. Between 2, 10 and 30-minute observations, the \tess\ Primary Mission and the ongoing extended missions have identified over \red{$\numTessCandidates$} planet candidates, \red{$\numTessPlanets$} of which have been confirmed as planets \citep{Stassun:2018:AJ, Stassun:2019:AJ, Guerrero:2021:ApJS, Guerrero:2021:AAS}.


Previously published \tess\ catalog paper on 2min data presented [info about these candidates -- using XX methods].
These catalogs have been used in the confirmation of planets (eg)  and determination of planetary occ rates (eg). 
Furthermore, systems identified as not-planetary in nature have yielded valuable new science on stellar binaries, including eclipsing (e.g., ), self-lensing (eg. ), and tidally interacting systems (e.g., ).

This paper uses (3) years of \tess photometry and the 2-min cadnece data to 

We also present the uniform modeling of all transiting planet candidates utilizing a Bayesian framework that provides robust estimates of the uncertainities for all of the planet parameters. 
The posterior distributions allow future researchers to study the planet population in detail and assess the reliability of the most Earth-like candidates.




Section~\ref{sec:prob-model} describes our transit lightcurve model and the Bayesian framework we use to estimate parameters of exoplanet systems from the observed data.

\section{Probabilistic Model} \label{sec:prob-model}

\subsection{Transit lightcurve model}
We assume that exoplanets are on circular, non-interacting Keplerian orbits around their host star.
Additonally, we approximate the host star's stellar limb darkening profile using \citet{Kipping:2013}'s quadratic limb darkening law.
Finally, we compute the exoplanet's resultant quadratic limb-darkened transit lightcurve using an analytical model implemented in \starry.
The stellar variables in this model are parameterised by
the baseline relative flux of the light curve $f0$,
the mean stellar density $\rho_\star$,
and two parameters describing the quadratic limb-darkening profile of the
star $u_1, u_2$.
Each of the $n$ exoplanets in the system are parameterised by the planets'
orbital period $P_{n}$,
transit duration $T_{n}$,
phase or epoch $t0_n$,
impact parameter $b_n$,
and the radius of the planet $r_n$ in units of the stellar radius $R_\star$.

We use \exoplanet\, \lightkurve


In the case when there are multiple transits present in the data, we use a second reference time $tmax$ instead of $P$


\section{Parameterization}

There are many options for parameterization of a transit, but we choose to model these transits as circular orbits parameterized by their observables.
We also track the relevant Jacobians.

The main parameters are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{two reference transit times}, one near the beginning of the observations, $t_0$, and one near the end, $t_{-1}$, measured in \tess\ BJD,
  \item \emph{the approximate transit depth}, $\delta$, measured in parts-per-thousand,
  \item \emph{the impact parameter} of the orbit, $b$, constrained to be $|b| \le 1$, and
  \item \emph{the transit duration}, $\tau$, measured in hours.
\end{enumerate}

With more discussion of the details, motivations, and limitations below.

\paragraph{Transit times}
To speed up the analysis, we assume that the discovery period and phase of the orbit are close enough to the truth that we can fit only the data near the expected transit times.
One consequence of this assumption is that we are assuming that the \emph{number} of periods that occur in the \tess\ observational baseline is correct.
Practically, this means that our prior assumption is that the transits must occur within the data cutouts.
This can be difficult to enforce---especially for low signal-to-noise transits---but a good approximation can be achieved by fitting for two reference transit times, $t_0$ and $t_{-1}$, with a fixed number of periods, $N_P$, between them, instead of a single reference time and the period.
Then we can compute the implied period as $P = (t_{-1} - t_0) / N_P$.
Importantly this does not change the prior on $P$ and $t_0$ since the Jacobian is a constant $1/N_P$.

\paragraph{Transit depth}
It is worth spending a moment on the transit depth parameterization.
This choice of parameterization leads to efficient computation and convergence, but it comes with non-trival shortcomings.
Since the physical parameter that is required to compute the light curve model is the radius ratio between the planet and the star $k = R_\mathrm{p} / R_\star$, we need to choose a parameterization that is invertible and that isn't generally possible.
In some cases, using radius ratio directly as the parameter can work well, but \todo{explain cases where it's not}.
Instead, we choose to parameterize the approximate transit depth $\delta$ using the small planet approximation.
This is useful because it is directly invertible (conditioned on the limb darkening parameters and impact parameter), but it restricts us to considering non-grazing transits with impact parameter $|b| \le 1$.
Accepting this restriction, we can compute the approximate transit depth for a limb darkened light curve by assuming that the intensity of the star is uniform under the disk of the planet.
For quadratic limb darkening, the intensity profile is
\begin{equation}
  I(r) = 1 - u_1\,[1 - \mu(r)] - u_2\,[1 - \mu(r)]^2
\end{equation}
where $\mu(r) = \sqrt{1 - r^2}$.
The ratio of the occulted flux to the total stellar flux when the transit is deepest ($r = b$) is \citep[the same results are discussed by][]{Mandel:2002,Csizmadia:2013}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \delta &\approx& \frac{\int_0^k\,2\,\pi\,r\,I(b)\dd r}{\int_0^1\,2\,\pi\,r\,I(r)\dd r} \nonumber\\
  &=& \frac{k^2\,\left(1 - u_1\,[1 - \mu(b)] - u_2\,[1 - \mu(b)]^2\right)}{1 - u_1/3 - u_2/6}\quad.
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, since $k$ must be positive, we have a one-to-one transformation between $\delta$ and $k$ conditioned on impact parameter $|b| \le 1$ and the limb darkening coefficients.
It is also important to include the Jacobian factor so that fitting in $\delta$ doesn't introduce a strange prior on $r$.
In this case, the relevant factor is
\begin{equation}
  \left|\frac{\dd k}{\dd \delta}\right| = \left|\frac{1 - u_1/3 - u_2/6}{2\,k\,\left(1 - u_1\,[1 - \mu(b)] - u_2\,[1 - \mu(b)]^2\right)}\right| \quad.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Impact parameter}
Constrained to be non-grazing. -- Discuss the consequences of this.

\paragraph{Transit duration}
The physical parameter required for computing the transit model is the semi-major axis, $a$, in units of the stellar radius, but the transit duration $\tau$ is better constrained so it can be better as a fit parameter.
For a circular orbit, the transit duration is \citep{Winn:2010}
\begin{equation}
  \tau = \frac{P}{\pi}\,\sin^{-1}\left( \frac{\sqrt{(1 + k^2) - b^2}}{a\,\sin i} \right) \quad.
\end{equation}
Rearranging this, we find
\begin{equation}
  a^2\,\sin^2 i\,\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi\,\tau}{P}\right) = (1 + k^2) - b^2 \quad.
\end{equation}
Then, using the fact that $\cos^2 i = b^2 / a^2$, we find
\begin{equation}
  a^2 = \frac{(1 + k)^2 - b^2\,\cos^2\phi}{\sin^2\phi}
\end{equation}
for $\phi = \pi\,\tau / P$.
And the Jacobian is
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\dd a}{\dd \tau} &=& \frac{\pi\,\cos \phi}{a\,P\,\sin^3 \phi}\,\left[b^2 - (1 + k)^2\right] \quad.
\end{eqnarray}

Finally, from the period and semi-major axis, we can compute the implied stellar density (under this assumption of a circular orbit)
\begin{equation}
  \rho_\mathrm{circ} = \frac{3\,\pi\,a^3}{G\,P^2} \quad.
\end{equation}
It is important to note that this is not necessarily the same as the actual stellar density and that, in a multi-planet system, this implied density won't be the same for each planet \citep[see, for example,][]{Dawson:2012, Kipping:2012}.
