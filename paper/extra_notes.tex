\textuit{INTRO VERSION 2:}
NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \tess\ \citep{Ricker:2015:JATIS} concluded its two-year Primary Mission to search for transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars in July 2020.
During this time, the \tess\ Science Processing Operations Center pipeline SPOC \citep{Jenkins:2016:SPIE}  recorded data with a 2-minute cadence for about $200,000$ pre-selected stars.
Additionally, \tess\ captured full-frame images of its entire field of view over 10- and 30-minute intervals, enabling flux measurements of several million stars.
Between 2, 10 and 30-minute observations, the \tess\ Primary Mission and the ongoing extended missions have identified over \red{$\numTessCandidates$} planet candidates, \red{$\numTessPlanets$} of which have been confirmed as planets \citep{Stassun:2018:AJ, Stassun:2019:AJ, Guerrero:2021:ApJS, Guerrero:2021:AAS}. Furthermore, \tess\ data have revealed new information on eclipsing binaries~\citep{ Guo:2020:MNRAS, Powell:2021:AJ}, tidally interacting systems~\citet{Holoien:2019:ApJ}, comets and exocomets~\citep{Farnham:2019:ApJL, Zieba:2019:A&A, Kuznyetsova:2020:OAP, Woods:2021:PASP, Pavlenko:2021:KPCB}),  variable stars~\citet{Antoci:2019:MNRAS, Handler:2020:NatAs}, supernovae~\cite{Vallely:2021:MNRAS, Fausnaugh:2021:ApJ}, and even black holes~\cite{Jayasinghe:2021:MNRAS}.
